# LabClaw

**Every research lab deserves a super brain.**

LabClaw is the first self-evolving AI platform for scientific laboratories. It encodes the complete scientific method as an autonomous computational loop — observe, hypothesize, experiment, validate, evolve — while accumulating persistent memory that makes it increasingly effective over time.

### Why LabClaw

| | Traditional Tools | LabClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | Manual notes, lost when people leave | Persistent 3-tier memory that remembers everything |
| **Instruments** | Disconnected from analysis | Real-time edge monitoring, 24/7 quality checks |
| **Learning** | Redundant experiments, no institutional knowledge | Self-evolving strategies that improve with every experiment |

### Architecture

```
Layer 5  PERSONA    Human + AI staff, training, promotion pipeline
Layer 4  MEMORY     Markdown + Knowledge Graph + Shared Blocks
Layer 3  ENGINE     OBSERVE → HYPOTHESIZE → EXPERIMENT → VALIDATE → EVOLVE
Layer 2  INFRA      FastAPI Gateway, Event Bus, Dashboard, Edge Nodes
Layer 1  HARDWARE   Device Registry, Safety Checker, Protocol Adapters
```
